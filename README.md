##  AI Assistance
While trying to make the map appear on the page using **OpenLayers**, I faced several issues that I couldn’t solve through research.  
Eventually, I asked for help from **AI (ChatGPT)**, and with its guidance, I switched to **Leaflet**, which successfully made the map visible on the web page.
